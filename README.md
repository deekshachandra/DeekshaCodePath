# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: DEEKSHA CHANDRA

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [yes] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [yes] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [yes] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [yes] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [yes] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used these resources when completing this challenge:

*https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_hidden.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Some challenges that I encountered while creating this submission is the small synatx errors that I had to look for. I have never written code
in HTML or Java, so this was surprisingly challenging in terms of having to look for small errors in code that I am not used to debugging. To ensure that
I didn't have any synatx error or small problems, I had to go through the code and look for inconsistencies in my work. Although it took some getting used to, 
I feel as though I am better equipped to find errors in other programming languages because of this challenge.
Additionally, sometimes I didn't quite understand the different function calls and implementations, which was kind of frustrating, 
but it challenged me to explore new concepts and ultimately, I learned a lot from it. I also found some great resources on HTML and Java programming, 
which could be benefical in the future. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some overarching questions that I have about web development are: 
What skills do I need to develop in order to become a proficient enough web developer to work in corporate industries?
Reading further into the subject of web development, I have come to understand that it takes 3 main skills to be acute at 
web development, the first having sufficient knowledge on the necessary programming languages. I know we coded this challenge
in HTML and Java, both of which are fun to work with, but will we see other programming lanuages used for web  development, or
is that something we are expected to retain with advancement? Additonally, I realized that error handling and debugging in these 
types of codes are very challenging and require a very specific attention to detail (i.e, you can look at some lines of code for
a while, and still miss small syntax errors). I was wondering if there were some skills or techniques to help guide us in what to look
for when facing these types of issues. Lastly, I am a creative person and love these types of small projects where I can show my ingenuity 
creativity through my code. What kind of projects do full-time web developers do, is it more project based or submisson based?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I think I would add my own creative flair to the game functionality. To be more specific, I think one of the options was to code a 
random secret pattern, which I thought was cool. Additionally, I would have liked to not only add more buttons, with a nicer design (better style.css implementation) and add a timer to the game.
I think that using my own design for the buttons could personalize my code and make it unique, while still remaining logical. Additionally, the timer adds a different layer of 
complexity to the game, which I think could have been interesting. I think these are the small variations I would have coded for to make my game a little bit more authentic to me.
